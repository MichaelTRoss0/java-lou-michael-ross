5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. 

The company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk ''s office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. 

Facts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. 
2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. 
4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. 
5. I went the court house and the clerk ''s office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk ''s office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk ''s office.', 'Company chooses not to provide a public response', 'Roob-Greenfelder', 'NY', '109XX', '', 1, 'Web', '2015-07-22', 'Closed with explanation', 1, 0),

My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n''t think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a " debt collector '''' and that any information given would be used in order to " collect on a debt ''''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance?

When I checked my loans myself, I found statements saying I needed to pay over XXXX dollars of standard repayments that had accrued in order to remove the delinquency ( i believe this is predatory and illegal ). Instead I contacted an Ombudsman from the XXXX. She instructed me to declare forbearance ( which Fedloan services did not tell me was an option. XXXXXXX services told me I had to pay the full 2 months payments on a standard repayment plan I was now on, and continue to pay that amount until a new XXX payment plan was processed. this sounded fraudulent so I contacted a XXXX ombudsman. 

After the Ombudsman talked with the student loan company, both parties ( lender and ombudsman ) told me on XXXX XXXX that I would be entered into forbearance and a new loan document asking me to pay a nominal {$5.00} fee would be sent to me. After this fee is payed, I was told I would enter my repayment plan. I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an XXX plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to " process '''' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the XXX plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? 

I believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my XXX plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the XXX XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. 

This entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an XXX plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the XXX plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. 

I am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the XXXX, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees.', null, 'Hintz-Botsford', 'MI', '488XX', '', 1, 'Web', '2017-01-10', 'Closed with explanation', 1, 1),

My main problem is with the Debt XXXXXXXXXX Company, the lesser complaint is with the school. 

I ''m currently in a dispute with my local community college regarding a small debt, either {$49.00} or {$79.00}, depending who I speak to. In XX/XX/XXXX I took XXXX XXXX XXXX classes and paid upfront with my credit card. One of the classes was canceled, and I was refunded the money for it. XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail a small slip of paper saying in part : " Dear XXXX, Please be advised you have a past due balance with XXXX for a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ... Pay by XX/XX/XXXX '''' It did not look like a bill or invoice and my name was not on the slip or the amount owed. I called the college that day and spoke to someone who could n''t tell me what class I owed for or provide any of the normal information that one would find on a bill or invoice. The woman I spoke to promised she would do research and get back to me, which never happened. 

I must point out, that I ''ve never been a matriculated student at this college or had a student loan. I registered and paid for XXXX XXXX classes in XX/XX/XXXX, attended XXXX, the XXXX was canceled, and the money for that class refunded. Also, the paperwork seems to indicate this " debt '''' was for something in XX/XX/XXXX, and I never registered for or attended ANY classes in XXXX. When I got the notice from the debt collector, I called the contact for the college on that notice and failed to receive any meaningful information that would indicate I owed them money. The woman was " too busy '''' to explain it other than to say that XXXX people in her department looked at the paperwork and agreed I owed them money. I responded that they should send me a proper invoice if they have such paperwork. 

At any rate, they sent this alleged debt to AR Resources Inc., and their first contact with me by mail, they sent the notice to an old address. The address is from at least 25 years ago or more. The XXXX college does not have this address on their records, so I believe AR Resources Inc deliberately used an absurdly old address so I would n''t get the notice. The reason I got the notice, despite the old address, is because I still live in my home town and people in the Post Office know me and where I live currently. 

I can not stress strongly enough that AR Resources Inc had to deliberately do EXTENSIVE research to find this address. It ''s not a simple clerical error. The house number they used was from the pre-XX/XX/XXXX era. Not before XX/XX/XXXX, but literally before my town had XXXX service, you know? When this address was valid, if you needed the police or ambulance, you would have had to dial the XXXX DIGIT PHONE NUMBER ON A ROTARY PHONE.', 'Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law', 'Donnelly LLC', 'NJ', '083XX', '', 1, 'Web', '2015-03-25', 'Closed with explanation', 1, 1),

The reason they had ceased is due to our filing a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy earlier in the year. Once the Bankruptcy was discharged, I reached out to XXXX to continue with payments.

I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest XXXXXXXX ''s posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n''t low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that ''s XXXXXXXX Magical Accounting for you! I ''m posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on XXXXXXXX to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people ''s balances. I do n''t even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n''t know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with XXXXXXXX ''s accounting. XXXXXXXX changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that XXXXXXXX is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son ''s account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business.

The dealer told me that I would be contacted by XXXXXXX One ( then RBS XXXXXXXX ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due. Sometime shortly after that XXXXXXX One sent me my first monthly billing statement. For the next 2 1/2 years XXXXXXX One set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements. During that time I faithfully made each payment on time and, on several occasions, made monthly payments for several months in advance. For these reasons I relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from XXXXXXX One to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment. In XXXX XXXX XXXXXXX One suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements. I did n''t notice ( I had been habituated by their monthly notices and I had been trained to think of sending a payment only after I was notified ) and, as a direct result of XXXXXXX One ''s failure to send a monthly billing statement, I was late with my XXXX payment. When their credit department contacted me I sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that I had n''t received a statement. Their customer service representative told me that I should have received a monthly billing statement, it was XXXXXXX One ''s policy to do so, verified my contact information ( which had n''t changed ) and, under the circumstances, waived the {$20.00} fee I had been assessed for being late. She also assured me that I would start to receive monthly billing statements again. Unfortunately, I did not. Nor did I notice. As a result of that failure on the part of XXXXXXX One I was again contacted in XXXX by their credit department that I was late again. I immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me. Mail it, fax it, e-mail it - I did n''t care. Just get one to me. This time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders. To date I have n''t received either. As a result I was late again in XXXX. I am not accusing XXXXXXX One of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but I find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident. I am never - and I do mean never - late with any of my other bills. I also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that XXXXXXX One gains from their own failure!

Furthermore, I should not be charged {$20.00} fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on XXXXXXX One ''s part to send me a monthly billing statement. I suspect that I am not the only customer of XXXXXXX One with this problem.

Recently, XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX ) purchased my mortgage from my previous lender, XXXXXXXX ( www.myloancare.com ). The transfer process has been very frustrating ; consumers should not be collateral damage in the loan transfer process, particularly given the fact that consumers do not consent to the buying and selling of their mortgages. This has created an incredible amount of work for me and wasted a lot of time, and this clearly has been the case for others too, as evidenced by XXXX '' reviews and XXXXXXXX online. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, payment from XXXX to XXXXXXXX went through for the remaining principle ( based on a XX/XX/XXXX calculation ) for my mortgage ; however, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXXXXX also auto-drafted the monthly payment from my checking account. XXXXXXXX does not have record of this on my online profile and they have not forwarded this payment to XXXX as both companies have said they would through the transfer process. 

XXXX now has sent me to a debt collector for failure to pay my XXXX payment and plans to auto- draft double my monthly payment from my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

This is unacceptable, and has to stop. Consumers rights need to be protected during the home buying and selling process and the onus of record keeping should not fall to the consumer, the innocent bystander in this process.

I was told that the fraudulent account was closed and a letter was sent to XXXXXXX requesting that the Credit Check be removed from my credit report. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted XXXXXXX. XXXXXXX is the only Credit Reporting Agency where this credit check appeared. I spoke with XXXX at XXXX. I asked her why the credit check was still on my credit report.

I was advised that they did in deed send a letter to XXXXXXX requesting that the credit check be removed. Further, I did a cover letter and sent XXXXXXX a copy of the letter which I received XXXX. This was sent in a fax for which I have a confirmation of receipt. My letter also requested that the credit check be removed immediately. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a letter from a third party company indicating that a hack had occurred on a company called XXXX. XXXX is a company that operates for XXXX, Florida XXXX. In this hack, employee and retired employee names, addresses, Social Security numbers, email addresses, pass words, etc. had been stolen. Obviously, this is where the suspect in the XXXX fraudulent account obtained my name and Social Security number. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called XXXX XXXX Fraud Department. I advised them that XXXXXXX claims that they did not send a letter to remove the fraudulent credit check. I was informed that this was not true. While on the telephone, the employee typed out another letter to XXXXXXX and sent it. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called XXXXXXX again. The credit check XXXX is still showing on my credit report.

I stated that I have the confirmation in which I faxed them my statement along with the XXXX letter. I then informed the employee that XXXX sent them another letter and I wanted to speak to a supervisor. The employee stated that there was nothing that could be done for me and the credit check only lasts on my report for two years. I told her that she was complicit in this fraud complaint and that she is a liar. As a result of this last conversation with XXXXXXX, I contacted the Attorney General ''s Office and was advised to file this complaint. See the attached documentation.

As a result my information has been misused fraudulently and there were charges incurred by parties unknown to me on several occasions on many of my accounts and I have been working relentlessly to remedy the negative effects of this. Almost ALL of the creditors and reporting agencies have done their own investigations and come to the realization that I have indeed been victimized, and most have cleared up their files. 

The one outrageous entity remaining, is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, CA, and their XXXX Collector, XXXX XXXX , who not only refuses to accept the numerous documentation and disputes I have submitted thru the past several years, but also keeps adding {$10000.00} to the fictitious amount they have been reporting ( over {$30000.00} ) each time I dispute their ridiculous charade! Their attempts to pressure the consumer by intimidation are beyond reason! Their lack of willingness to examine the evidence and come to the conclusions that everyone else has, seems like a sinister ordeal! Furthermore, this is all on a corporate account that I was associated with as one of the managers! Where is the Original Instrument of debt? Why are they pursuing me when they have no other recourse? 

Their Ref. # is : XXXX / XXXX ( original Creditor of record ) file number is XXXX The corporation in question was XXXX XXXX XXXX which was owned by some other corporation, ALL of which are dissolved. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX info is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX . XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Contact : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Collector Ph. XXXX Fax : XXXX They continue to disregard the fact that XXXX HAS acknowledged that there was indeed fraudulent activity, unauthorized account ( s ) and unauthorized use of my information ( XXXX file # XXXX ), and that we have always continued to dispute their report, and said balances and amounts repeatedly. In fact, the representatives from XXXX ( and on a separate occasion, an IRS agent ) are the ones who informed me about the fraudulent activities, and I was unaware of this and the extent of it previous to that! 
Further, the above referenced claim is on a corporate account, and that company was owned by yet XXXX other corporations, all of which have been dissolved and out of business for several years. Simply having been point of contact, or having made any good faith efforts to resolve this while investigating the information does not constitute acceptance of liability by me personally, nor an agreement to the accuracy of the information reported by said collection company in any way. 
Initially, XXXX notified us of fraudulent activity, the IRS investigated and notified me of falsified Tax reports under my information and fixed it and recommended putting a Fraud Alert on my file. Police, FTC and other authorities were notified and reports were filed and Credit Freeze/Alerts were put in place. Since then, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and several other institutions have investigated and acknowledge this and ALL have corrected their records. Yet they refuse to comply despite having been provided with ample documentation to that effect and several letters of dispute! 
I have continuously disputed the information, and any personal liability in this matter. That position has not changed, and I demand - once again - that this be corrected and struck from any consumer reports. I am attaching some of the aforementioned supporting documents, and there more available upon request. I appreciate your attention to this matter!

The date of first delinquency determines how long a negative account can remain on your credit reports and a negative credit item, such as a charge-off can only remain on my credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Section 623 ( 5 ) ( A ) says : " In general. A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action.

I ''ve been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. 

Tonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to XXX Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer XXX Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But XXX never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. XXX displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with " XXXX '''' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the XXX site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the XXX site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site ''s issues. 

There is obviously something seriously wrong with the XXX website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with XXX, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked.
